<h1>Wisdom First</h1>

<p>"Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding."</p>

<p>The verse Proverbs 4:7 explains that we should pursue wisdom above all else, as to pursue wisdom is to pursue God. True wisdom is not earthly, while earthly wisdom may lead us to short "victories" in our lives, 
maybe through immoral means, but it will ultimately lead to ruin without the guidance of God. </p>

  <p>
    In the context of proverbs, Solomon told his son to pursue wisdom above all things. True wisdom is not just earthly knowledge, 
    nor is it wisdom that can be obtained without the pursuit of God. But a specific wisdom, a wisdom that can only come from God. God's wisdom leads us to love our neighbors just as Christ has loved us. Through God's wisdom, we can see the world for what it truly is, 
    because God is truth, and through God's wisdom, we can be guided in life to pursue what is good and avoid evil.
